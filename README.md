# Bike_Share

## -- Project Introduction --

**Goal:** **Optimize** the profitability of the bike-sharing system

**Description:** This project analyzes bike-sharing system datasets from August 29, 2013, to August 31, 2015. Me and the other two members analyze the **user profile**, **bike unavailable frequency**, and **operational status** to identify areas for improvement. 

**Results:** By implementing a fee-adjustment strategy and optimizing bike scheduling, we successfully **reduced monthly costs by 8%**. 

**Skills:** data cleaning,  data analysis,  data visualization(EDA),  geospatial visualizations  
**Technology:** Python,  Excel,  Pandas,  Numpy,  Seaborn,  Matplotlib,  Plotly,  Folium,  Osmnx.

## -- Datasets Introduction -- 

**Data Source:** [Bike-Sharing Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share "link")  

**Context:**  The Bay Area Bike Share enables quick, easy, and affordable bike trips around the San Francisco Bay Area. They make regular open data releases (this dataset is a transformed version of the data from this link), plus maintain a real-time API.  

**Content(4 datasets):** The dataset spans from August 29, 2013, to August 31, 2015, and includes 70 stations distributed across five cities.    
**station.csv** - Contains data that represents a station where users can pickup or return bikes.  
**status.csv** - data about the number of bikes and docks available for given station and minute.  
**trips.csv** - Data about individual bike trips.  
**weather.csv** - Data about the weather on a specific day for certain zip codes.
