# Bike_Share

## -- Project Introduction --

**Goal:** Optimize the bike-sharing system's profits  

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing the datasets of bike-sharing systems from August 29, 2013, to August 31, 2015. Me and the other two members analyze the user profile, bike unavailable frequency, and operational status.  

**Results:** Giving the strategy for fee adjustment mechanism and bike scheduling end up reducing 8% monthly cost.  

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization(EDA), geospatial visualizations.  
**Technology:** Python, Excel, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, folium, Osmnx.  

**Code:** bike_route.ipynb(only including the geo-map part, the other can refer to presentation doc.)  
**Final Presentation:** Bike-Share Analysis Project  

## -- Datasets Introduction -- 

**Data Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share  

**Context:**  The Bay Area Bike Share enables quick, easy, and affordable bike trips around the San Francisco Bay Area. They make regular open data releases (this dataset is a transformed version of the data from this link), plus maintain a real-time API.  

**Content(4 datasets):** The dataset spans from August 29, 2013, to August 31, 2015, and includes 70 stations distributed across five cities.
